*"Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy."*

Mark Zuckerberg says that privacy is no longer a social norm. That annoys me both because I think he's correct and I think it shouldn't be that way.

People have been careless. We, and that includes me, have used services for years that seemed like a free lunch and now the chickens are coming home to roost. We're realising that everywhere around us exists near-complete tracking and surveillance.

It doesn't need to be this way though. Indeed it could be easily fixed if we all started taking reasonable (not tin-foil hat wearing) steps to protect our privacy and the privacy of our user and customers.

This privacy policy outlines how to do that and the steps I've taken on [DerykMakgill.com](/) to protect your privacy and mine.

## Privacy Advice

You should read my complete guide to [privacy,](/) but the TLDR is this...

- Use [FireFox](/) or [Brave Browser](/) to browse the site.
- Subscribe to my email list with [ProtonMail](/) or a comparable email service.
- Use a VPN such as [ProtonVPN.](/)
- Pay for products in Bitcoin.
- Search for site content with [DuckDuckGo](/) search engine.

Privacy is all our responsibility, not just the site owner's!

## Site Analytics

I use [Fathom Analytics,](https://usefathom.com/ref/QDNHKF) a privacy-preserving open-source analytics software by Paul Jarvis. It's so private, you don't even need to add one of those notices that are so common today.

I can't tell who you are. I can't see your IP, your email address, your previous browsing history, etc. I can't use the data to send you ads or track you around the web. All I can tell is who is visiting the website, what pages they view, how long they stay on the page, and the country of origin. 

I don't share or rent that data with anyone.

## Mailing Lists

Anything I send to my mailing lists is untracked. I do not use tracking pixels of any kind and I cannot tell if you opened, clicked, etc, unless you reply to me.

I might in the future give some free handouts to people who sign up for my newsletters using a more private email service like ProtonMail instead of Gmail.

## Affiliate Links

I use affiliate links from various products and services I use and recommend. This means I get paid when you click an affiliate link and buy something I recommend! But if often means you get a discount too. 

Some of these links will track you. You should clear your browsing cookies *after* *wink wink* you buy something.
