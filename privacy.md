*"Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy."*

Mark Zuckerberg says that privacy is no longer a social norm. That annoys me both because I think he's correct and I think it shouldn't be that way.

People have been careless. We, and that includes me, have used services for years that seemed like a free lunch and now the chickens are coming home to roost. We're realising that everywhere around us exists near-complete tracking and surveillance.

It doesn't need to be this way though. Indeed it could be easily fixed if we all started taking reasonable (not tin-foil hat wearing) steps to protect our privacy and the privacy of our user and customers.

This privacy policy outlines how to do that and the steps I've taken on [DerykMakgill.com](/) to protect your privacy and mine.

## Privacy Advice

You should read my complete guide to [privacy,](/) but the TLDR is this...

- Use [FireFox](/) or [Brave Browser](/) to browse the site.
- Subscribe to my email list with [ProtonMail](/) or a comparable email service.
- Use a VPN such as [ProtonVPN.](/)
- Pay for products in Bitcoin.
- Search for site content with [DuckDuckGo](/) search engine.
- Don't email me or post anything on this site, under your name or another name, that you woudn't feel comfortable having tied to your real identity.

Privacy is all our responsibility, not just the site owner's!

## Site Analytics

I use [Fathom Analytics,](https://usefathom.com/ref/QDNHKF) a privacy-preserving open-source analytics software by Paul Jarvis. It's so private, you don't even need to add one of those notices that are so common today.

I can't tell who you are. I can't see your IP, your email address, your previous browsing history, etc. I can't use the data to send you ads or track you around the web. All I can tell is who is visiting the website, what pages they view, how long they stay on the page, and the country of origin. 

I don't share or rent that data with anyone.

## Mailing Lists

Anything I send to my mailing lists is untracked. I do not use tracking pixels of any kind and I cannot tell if you opened, clicked, etc, unless you reply to me.

I might in the future give some free handouts to people who sign up for my newsletters using a more private email service like ProtonMail instead of Gmail.

## Affiliate Links

I use affiliate links from various products and services I use and recommend. This means I get paid when you click an affiliate link and buy something I recommend! But if often means you get a discount too. 

Some of these links will track you. You should clear your browsing cookies *after* *wink wink* you buy something.

## Comments

I don't currently have comments on this site because I haven't found a good way to do it on a static site that protects privacy. This may change in the future.

You will *always* be able to request that your comments be deleted later and I will do my best to have archive pages with your comments removed as well.

## Archive Services

Archive.org, Archive.Today, are hereby notified that I request they do not archive this site without written permission from me.
